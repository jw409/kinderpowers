# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Every agent and skill is a parameterized canvas -- server hints, caller decides
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — sequential-thinking-spawn-hints

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (sequential-thinking-spawn-hints) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P03 | 1min | 1 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 01 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phases 1 and 2 are independent (Rust vs agent .md files) -- can parallelize
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (workflow files updated in collapse are same ones gaining bead calls)
- Phases 4 and 5 follow the parameterization patterns established in Phase 2 collapse
- [Phase 01]: spawn_strategy defaults to none -- callers opt in to spawning behavior
- [Phase 01]: spawn_meta is Option on Hint struct rather than separate type, keeping hints array homogeneous

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CONCERNS.md notes duplicate GSD binary tree (gsd/bin/ vs gsd/get-shit-done/bin/) -- not blocking v6.2 but avoid modifying gsd/get-shit-done/ files
- env::set_var test pollution in sequential-thinking -- be aware when adding Phase 1 tests
